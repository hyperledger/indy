# Hyperledger Indy

![Indy Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hyperledger/indy-node/main/collateral/logos/indy-logo.png)

Hyperledger Indy is an open source implementation of a distributed ledger,
purpose-built for identity solutions using privacy preserving verifiable
credentials.

If you are a developer, begin your journey by looking at an Aries Framework that
interact with Indy, such as [Aries Cloud Agent Python](https://aca-py.org),
[Credo TS](https://github.com/openwallet-foundation/credo-ts) or [Aries
VCX](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-vcx)

## Key Characteristics

Distributed ledger purpose-built for decentralized identity

- Correlation-resistant by design
- DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers) that are globally unique and resolvable (via
  a ledger) without requiring any centralized resolution authority
- Pairwise Identifiers create secure, 1:1 relationships between any two entities
- Verifiable Claims are interoperable format for exchange of digital identity
  attributes and relationships currently in the standardization pipeline at the
  W3C
- Zero Knowledge Proofs which prove that some or all of the data in a set of
  Claims is true without revealing any additional information, including the
  identity of the Prover
